## Usage

### Socials Card Example

```tsx
import SocialsCard from "@/components/socials-card";

export default function Example() {
  return <SocialsCard />;
}
```

## Understanding the component

The card uses a subtle elevation shadow that collapses on press, creating a tactile feel. Motion is powered by a spring animation for a responsive interaction.
