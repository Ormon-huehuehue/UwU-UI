This\n          means that the designer must approach each new problem with an open\n          mind and must seek to solve it by analysing it objectively. The\n          difficulties of the task are due to the enormous differences in the\n          demands made on the designer by the various assignments he receives. A\n          small newspaper advertisement does not present the difficulties of\n          designing, say, a daily paper with 10 and more columns. a great\n          variety of subjects, and an additional advertising section. Such a\n          task calls not only for designing talent but also organizing ability\n          since the many constantly changing items of information have to be\n          arranged in a logical order and their priorities reflected in\n          appropriate typography.\n        </TextCursorProximity>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n",
