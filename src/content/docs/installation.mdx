The components are built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and mainly with Motion (formerly Framer Motion).
In order to use the components, you need to install the following dependencies:

<InstallTabs command="tailwindcss@latest motion" />

Or follow the [Tailwind CSS installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to setup Tailwind CSS in your project.

Some components uses other libraries too, in each case, you can find the installation instructions in the component's documentation.

## Adding a component

You have two options to add a component to your project:

1. Manually
2. Using the CLI (coming soon)

### Manually

Go to any of the components you want to use and copy the source code(s) from the "code" section. 
Make sure to update your imports accordingly.
We will be adding a CLI soon.

## Notes

If you prefer javascript instead of typescript, you can easily convert the code with a tool like [this](https://transform.tools/typescript-to-javascript).
